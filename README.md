In this Deep Learning project, I used Sequential Modeling offered by Tensorflow (Python). The dataset of the project is stored in text file which consists of NumPy arrays representing images of all 32 handwritten letters in Azerbaijani language. After loading and preparing the data for modeling, I used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to train a model for classification using convolutional layers by Conv2D and Max Pooling methods. In the process of training, I also used Dropout and data augmentation techniques to prevent overfitting.
